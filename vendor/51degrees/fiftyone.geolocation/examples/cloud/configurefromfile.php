/**
* @example cloud/configurefromfile.php
* This example shows how to configure a pipeline from a configuration file
* using the pipelinebuilder's buildFromConfig method.
*
* This example is available in full on [GitHub](https://github.com/51Degrees/location-php/blob/master/examples/cloud/configurefromfile.php).
* To run this example, you will need to create a **resource key**.
* The resource key is used as short-hand to store the particular set of
* properties you are interested in as well as any associated license keys
* that entitle you to increased request limits and/or paid-for properties.
* You can create a resource key using the 51Degrees [Configurator](https://configure.51degrees.com/gGc3T5pT). 
* 
* This example uses the 'Country' property, which is pre-populated 
* when creating a key using the link above.
* 
* The configuration file used here is:
*
* ```
*{
*  "PipelineOptions": {
*    "Elements": [
*      {
*        "BuilderName": "fiftyone\\pipeline\\cloudrequestengine\\CloudRequestEngine",
*        "BuildParameters": {
*          "resourceKey": "!!YOUR_RESOURCE_KEY!!"
*        }
*      },
*      {
*        "BuilderName": "fiftyone\\pipeline\\geolocation\\GeoLocationCloud"
*      }
*    ]
*  }
* }
* ```
*
* Expected output
* ```
* Which country is the location [51.458048,-0.9822207999999999] in?
* UK
* ```
